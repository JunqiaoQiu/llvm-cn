"By default profile data is merged without modification. This means that "
"the relative importance of each input file is proportional to the number "
"of samples or counts it contains. In general, the input from a longer "
"training run will be interpreted as relatively more important than a "
"shorter run. Depending on the nature of the training runs it may be "
"useful to adjust the weight given to each input file by using the "
"``-weighted-input`` option."
